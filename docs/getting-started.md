# Getting started

## Requirements

Starflow is a Node module, so Node must be installed on your machine. Check out the [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) section of the Node official website!

## Install

Install Starflow as a dev dependency of your project using `npm`: 

```
npm install --save-dev starflow
```

That's it, you can now require Starflow in any module to let it process your workflow tasks.

## What now?

Starflow is now ready to read and process your workflow(s), but how? Check out the [How to use it] section!
